# WAREHOUSE-INVENTORY-SALES-PURCHASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Worked with tkinter module in Python
This code creates database itself and we can manipulate the data through the frontend. But the database created by the code is empty. I tried to keep the UI as simple as possible. I've uploaded the database file by adding 15 entries in the database. I've added data by importing the saved excel spreadsheet in the CSV format through the DB SQLite Browser.
